🚖 OLA Data Analyst SQL Project
📖 Project Overview

This project is based on an OLA Data Analyst case study, where I performed SQL analysis on a ride-booking dataset.
The dataset contains information about bookings, cancellations, ratings, payments, revenues, and ride statuses.
The goal was to use SQL to answer important business questions and derive meaningful insights.

🎯 Project Goals

Understand how a ride-hailing company like OLA manages booking and customer data.

Write SQL queries to solve real-world business problems.

Practice using aggregations, filtering, grouping, and views for analysis.

Derive insights on customer behavior, cancellation trends, ratings, and revenues.

⚡ Challenges Faced

Designing a structured dataset from raw booking information.

Managing multiple ride statuses (Success, Cancelled by Customer, Cancelled by Driver, Incomplete).

Writing optimized SQL queries using GROUP BY, HAVING, LIMIT, and JOIN.

Ensuring query results match realistic business constraints (e.g., cancellation rates < 7%).

Creating queries that can be easily reused by saving them as views.
